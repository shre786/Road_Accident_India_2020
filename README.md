# Regulatory Affairs of Road Accident Data 2020 India
📌 Overview

This project analyzes road accident data for India in 2020 to identify trends, causes, and outcomes of incidents. The dataset contains details such as the location of accidents, causes, and accident severity, which are explored using data cleaning, visualization, and analysis techniques.
The aim is to provide insights for regulatory affairs and policy-making, enabling data-driven decisions to improve road safety.

🎯 Problem Statement

Road accidents are a significant public safety concern in India, leading to thousands of fatalities and injuries every year. The challenge is to analyze accident data from 2020 to:
Understand where and why accidents occur.
Identify patterns and high-risk factors.
Suggest potential preventive measures.

📂 Dataset

File: Regulatory Affairs of Road Accident Data 2020 India.csv
Features (examples):
Location (City/State)
Accident Cause

Number of Incidents

Severity/Outcome (Fatal, Injury, Property Damage, etc.)

🛠️ Techniques Used

Data Cleaning – Removed missing/irrelevant entries and formatted columns for consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Explored structure, shape, and statistical summary of the dataset.
Data Visualization – Used bar charts, pie charts, and stacked bar plots for better insights.
Distribution Analysis – Studied distribution of accident counts across cities and categories.
Cause Analysis – Compared the frequency of different accident causes.
Outcome Analysis – Examined the severity distribution of accidents.
Cause vs Outcome Relationship – Used stacked bar plots to understand the link between accident causes and their outcomes.

📊 Key Insights

Certain states and cities have higher accident rates, indicating potential problem zones.
Human errors (overspeeding, negligence) contribute significantly to accidents.
Fatal accidents are more common in regions with poor road infrastructure and high-speed corridors.
